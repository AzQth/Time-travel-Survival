# Time-travel-Survival
Submission for BlackThornProd's game jam. I was minutes late because I wanted to write a description, so I thought I could put it here.
Hello! This is the first ever game jam game that I've actually gotten to a playable state by the time the game jam is over, so, despite the graphics being pretty much blocks, circles and hexagons, I'm quite happy with it.

I was, unfortunately, unable to get everything I wanted done, but I gather that that's somewhat common in game jams, and it's better than my previous attempts.

I did not have time to include a tutorial, so I'll do my best to explain here:
You activate the UI for structures by walking near them. You have 3 main resources: wood, stone and food, which you gather from the forest, cave and pond respectively. There is also the fire, which slowly ticks down from 100% over time, and goes down at a slightly faster rate whenever you gather resources, as this progresses the day. If at any point, in any timeline (I'll get back to that later), the fire runs out, you lose, but it is fairly easy to top up, since it only needs wood. At the end of every day, you lose 1 food. If you have 0 food at the end of the day, you lose.

Gathering resources gets you a random amount between a minimum of 1 and some maximum, which varies between them. You can spend wood and stone to upgrade your capabilities in each one, increasing the maximum amount of the resource you can get every time you collect.
Every time you upgrade something, the resource cost doubles.


Now on to the time travel! The totem pole (that brown rectangle in the bottom left that I didn't have time to make a proper sprite for) is what lets you do it. Walking up to it brings up its UI.


The bottom slider lets you choose how many days you are going to go back. The number next to it shows this amount, and clicking on it will actually trigger the time travel. Time travelling will create a new timeline that only has the days up to the point you travelled to. You will have the resources, upgrades and fire percent that you had at that time, plus any resources you sent back with you.


The small X next to the totem pole will appear if you have recently time travelled, and means that it is on cooldown. The cooldown consists of the days back you went. This is just so you can't constantly double your resources and outrun your present.


The three sliders above this let you pick how much of your current resources you are sending back with you. You will have less in the starting timeline, but much more in the new one (yes, this is where the 'less is more' comes into it).


Finally, there's the arrangement on the far left, which consists of a number in the center with two arrows on the top and bottom. The number displays your current timeline. You start in timeline 0. The arrows let you move between different timelines, but only ones in the same present as the one you're in (e.g timeline 0 is in day 15, 1 is in day 4 and 2 is in day 5. You would need to wait a day so that both timelines 1 and 2 are on day 5 before you can move between them, and a further 10 days before you can move between all 3). Only timelines in the same present as your current one will face problems such as the fire depleting, running out of food, etc.




The bar at the top shows your current day and the progress through it. Collecting resources takes time, and will progress this further.


So: how do you win?

You win the game by upgrading your fire to level 8, at which point it is enough to signal for help, and bring assistance to take you off the island. Since the cost of upgrading doubles every time, this might seem a lot, but effective use of time travel can achieve this fairly easily. It's also quite fun to just mess around and see how many resources you can amass.


Now that is all out of the way, I hope you at least have fun trying my little game here, and thank you for trying it in the first place, it's greatly appreciated.
